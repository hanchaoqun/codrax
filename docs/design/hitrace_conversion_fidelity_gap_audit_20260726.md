# HiTrace Conversion Fidelity Gap Audit and Remediation Plan (2026-07-26)

## Scope and baseline

Baseline: `main@23c0c58ef`.

Customer symptoms:

- a pure Harmony/OpenHarmony `.sys` capture contains thread names but the
  generated systrace contains many `unknown` comm values;
- the generated systrace loses a large share of trace-marker spans;
- Donghu captures can carry a host TID/TGID in the ftrace header and a
  namespace PID in the `B|pid|...` / `C|pid|...` marker payload.

Reference witnesses:

- `/Users/han/opt/donghu/donghu.ftrace`;
- `/Users/han/opt/donghu/xxx_all.systrace`;
- hmtrace snapshot `7fb4eabae01f310beccecf339403aca4e9660131`;
- OpenHarmony SmartPerf `trace_streamer`;
- OpenHarmony Hiview trace collection sources.

The two text traces are different captures. They prove the host/namespace PID
shape and rich event-family expectations, but they are not a binary conversion
A/B pair and cannot quantify one capture's conversion loss.

## Confirmed failure chains

### Thread names

1. `sched_switch_lite` carries no `prev_comm` / `next_comm`.
2. The reviewed trace_streamer source can select the lite scheduler family and
   stop consuming later full scheduler rows that carry names.
3. Saved cmdlines populate an event comm but do not name lite prev/next
   identities.
4. Codrax SQL export reads display names only from `thread.name`.
5. Empty `thread.name` becomes `unknown` in registration, scheduler, wakeup and
   callstack output. There is no conversion-quality downgrade.

### Donghu namespace PID and span suppression

1. A ftrace row carries the host TID/TGID.
2. Its trace-marker payload carries a namespace PID.
3. The reviewed trace_streamer print/slice path binds the public TID to the
   marker payload PID, creating or selecting a different internal thread
   identity from the scheduler identity.
4. Scheduler Running intervals remain attached to the host internal identity.
5. Codrax looks up start/end CPU by the callstack internal identity.
6. `unknown_start_cpu` / `unknown_end_cpu` rejects the complete span.

Codrax's refusal to invent CPU 0 is correct. The gap is the absence of a typed
host/namespace identity relation and the coupling of span existence to CPU
availability.

## Remediation batches

### Batch A — conversion-quality authority and customer diagnostics

Status: implemented in the working tree on 2026-07-26.

- Add exact `TraceDBCoverage.metrics`.
- Count unnamed accepted threads.
- Count public TIDs represented by multiple ITIDs and owner IPIDs.
- Count scheduler boundaries rendered with at least one unknown comm.
- Count callstack pre-pairing, CPU, identity and shared sync-span suppression.
- Insert a bounded `conversion_quality/__semantic_quality__` coverage row near
  the front of CLI/REPL disclosure.
- Emit a soft `semantic quality is degraded` caveat. It never blocks conversion
  and never changes source admission.

### Batch B — name fidelity

- Preserve a typed name-source roster.
- Recover names from exact full scheduler comm, task rename and saved cmdlines.
- Use process display fallback only for a proven main thread.
- Keep ambiguity fail-closed for identity while allowing display-only name
  recovery.
- Add full/lite/mixed-family and empty-thread-name fixtures.

### Batch C — host/namespace dual identity

- Preserve host TID/TGID/ITID separately from marker subject PID/ITID.
- Treat marker PID as span subject, never as host owner authority.
- Reconcile a marker ITID to a host scheduler ITID only when the public TID,
  source, timestamp and lifecycle produce one exact candidate.
- Emit the host header identity while retaining the namespace PID in the marker
  payload.
- Keep ambiguous candidates typed-unavailable.

### Batch D — span existence versus CPU availability

- Use a recovered exact host scheduler identity for endpoint CPU placement.
- Keep `span_present` distinct from `cpu_status`.
- Do not copy hmtrace's unconditional CPU-0 default.
- Preserve CPU-unavailable spans in a query-ready typed sidecar/bundle lane when
  classic systrace cannot represent an unknown CPU safely.
- Localize async poison to exact keys and retain suppression counts.

### Batch E — coverage closure

- Enumerate all non-internal DB tables and classify each as exported,
  resolver-only, structured-sidecar, empty or unsupported.
- Expand typed raw-family coverage needed by trace_query.
- Make unhandled nonempty tables visible.
- Commit a redistributable representative no-perf `.sys` fixture with SQL and
  explicit builtin parity assertions.

## Invariants

- Never fabricate CPU, PID, TGID, comm, timestamp or lifecycle evidence.
- Namespace PID must not replace host ownership.
- Display-name recovery must not become identity authority.
- Quality ratios and counts are advisory unless a future hard gate reads a
  precise typed invariant.
- Production emits one selected trace body; diagnostic comparison must not
  merge two independently converted bodies.
